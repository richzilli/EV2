# During the course, I've learned a lot more about the analysis that can go into the decision making into businesses. Along the course, I was able to understand new programming techniques such as linear programmming as well as forecasting. Furthermore, we were introduced into new libraries and other new tools that can implement our work on Pyhton such as numpy. Given these topics, we have been able to grasp onto new ways for our forthcoming careers. As a marketing major, I'm very excited to implement programming into my professional endeavours, as well as into the various planning that we all know that the job requires.
